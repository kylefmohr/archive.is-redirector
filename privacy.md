### Privacy Policy: 

This extension is designed with your privacy in mind. **We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data or browsing history.** The list of domains you configure for redirection and your preference settings (such as whether to redirect homepages) are stored locally within your Chrome browser using Chrome's storage system (which may include Chrome Sync if you have it enabled). This information is used solely for the extension to function as intendedâ€”to identify when to redirect a page to archive.is. The URLs of the pages you visit are processed locally by the extension and are not sent to us or any third party, except for the explicit redirection to archive.is itself. If you choose to use the "Use Recommended Domains" feature, the extension will fetch a predefined list of domains from a public GitHub repository; this action is user-initiated, and the fetched list is then stored locally like your other settings.
